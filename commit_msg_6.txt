refactor: Split AuthController into authentication and registration controllers

- Create RegisterController for user registration logic
- Create PasswordController for password management
- Keep login/logout in AuthController
- Extract registration validation methods

This refactoring improves code organization by separating:
- Authentication (login/logout) - AuthController
- Registration (signup, validation) - RegisterController
- Password management - PasswordController

Original controller: 666 lines
New structure: 3 controllers with clear separation of concerns
