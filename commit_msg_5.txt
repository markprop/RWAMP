refactor: Split CryptoPaymentController into domain-specific controllers

- Create InvestorDashboardController for investor dashboard
- Create InvestorHistoryController for payment/transaction history
- Create BuyFromResellerController for reseller purchase operations
- Keep main purchase flow in CryptoPaymentController

This refactoring separates concerns:
- Purchase flow remains in CryptoPaymentController
- Investor-specific features moved to Investor namespace
- Reseller purchase features moved to BuyFromReseller namespace

Original controller: 823 lines
New structure: 4 controllers with clear responsibilities
