feat: add game maintenance commands and scheduled tasks

This commit adds Artisan commands for game system maintenance and updates the scheduler to run automated tasks.

New Commands:
- PruneGamePriceHistory: Removes old price history records to maintain database performance
- ResetStuckGameStates: Resets game sessions that are stuck in invalid states
- SyncMissingUsers: Synchronizes user data and ensures consistency

Scheduled Tasks:
- Game price history pruning (daily)
- Stuck game state recovery (hourly)
- Crypto payment monitoring (every 5 minutes)
- Exchange rate updates (hourly)
- Missing wallet generation (daily)

These commands help maintain system health and automate routine maintenance tasks.
