refactor: Split ResellerController into smaller, focused controllers

BREAKING CHANGE: Routes need to be updated to use new controllers

- Create ResellerDashboardController for dashboard metrics
- Create ResellerUserController for user management
- Create ResellerPaymentController for payment operations
- Create ResellerTransactionController for transaction management
- Create ResellerSellController for sell operations
- Create ResellerBuyRequestController for buy request management

This refactoring improves code maintainability by following the
Single Responsibility Principle. Each controller now handles
a specific domain of reseller functionality.

Original controller: 922 lines
New controllers: 6 controllers averaging ~130 lines each

See RESELLER_CONTROLLER_REFACTORING.md for route update instructions.
