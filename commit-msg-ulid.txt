feat: implement ULID-based URL obfuscation for sensitive admin routes

This commit adds ULID (Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier) support for obfuscating sensitive admin routes, replacing numeric IDs with shorter, non-sequential identifiers.

Features:
- HasUlid trait for automatic ULID generation on models
- ULID columns added to crypto_payments, users, reseller_applications, withdraw_requests tables
- BackfillUlids command to migrate existing records
- SyncMissingUsers command for user synchronization
- Shortened admin routes using ULID prefixes (e.g., /a/p/{ulid}, /a/u/{ulid})

Benefits:
- Prevents enumeration attacks on sensitive resources
- Shorter, more user-friendly URLs
- Maintains chronological ordering
- Backward compatibility with numeric IDs via redirects

Affected Routes:
- Admin crypto payments: /a/p/{payment}/details
- Admin users: /a/u/{user}/details
- Admin applications: /a/ap/{application}/details
- Admin withdrawals: /a/w/{withdrawal}
- Admin game settings: /a/g/settings
