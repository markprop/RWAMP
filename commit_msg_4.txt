refactor: Begin AdminController refactoring into focused controllers

- Create AdminDashboardController for dashboard metrics
- Create AdminUserController for user management operations
- Extract dashboard and user management logic

This is the first phase of AdminController refactoring. The original
controller (2,381 lines) will be split into 10 focused controllers
following the Single Responsibility Principle.

Remaining controllers to be created:
- AdminCryptoPaymentController
- AdminKycController
- AdminWithdrawalController
- AdminResellerApplicationController
- AdminPriceController
- AdminSellController
- Admin2FAController
- AdminChatController

See ADMIN_CONTROLLER_REFACTORING_IMPLEMENTATION.md for details.
